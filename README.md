# Wonderlust

This is the frontend part of a two-repositories project. 
This project is an attempt to build a "booking" app for apartments like Airbnb. This project was just an experiment meant to help me learn building a frontend and backend app.

## Libraries

- React.
- react-router.
- date-fns.
- material UI.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs frontend of the app. Expects the backend to be running on localhost:3001.
